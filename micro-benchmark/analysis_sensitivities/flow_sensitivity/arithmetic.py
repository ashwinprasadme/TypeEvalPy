# A simple Python program that defines a function called 'arithmetic_op'.
# The function takes two integer parameters 'a' and 'b', adds them together and returns.
# The code is flow-sensitive because it changes its type of 'result' based on the flow of the program execution.


def arithmetic_op(a, b):
    result = "Hello"
    result = a + b
    return result


result = arithmetic_op(5, 10)
