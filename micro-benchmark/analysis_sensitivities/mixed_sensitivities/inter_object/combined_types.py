# Program defines a class called CombinedTypesOperation which takes one parameter x in its constructor, and has a method called combined_types that performs different operations on the x attribute based on its type.
# This program is object-sensitive and interprocedural as the behavior of the combined_types method depends on the type and value of the x attribute of the instance, and it calls other functions to perform the operations.
