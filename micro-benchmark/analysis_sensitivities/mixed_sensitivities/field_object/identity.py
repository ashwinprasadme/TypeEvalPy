# Program defines a class called IdentityOperation which takes one parameter x in its constructor, and has a method called identity that simply returns the x attribute. # The class also has a member variable called result that stores the result of the computation.
# This is object sensitive and the behavior of the identity method depends on the type of the x attribute of the instance.
# This is field-sensitive , allowing the value member variable to store different types of values in different contexts.

    def __init__(self, x):
        self.x = x
